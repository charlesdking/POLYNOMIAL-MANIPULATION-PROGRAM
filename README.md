# POLYNOMIAL-MANIPULATION-PROGRAM
Used Java to create a program that would take numbers from the user and create a polynomial ordered in ascending order by exponent and stored in a linked list. The program would also perform such operations as addition and multiplication of two different polynomials and contains a copy constructor.
